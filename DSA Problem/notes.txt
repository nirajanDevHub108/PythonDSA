"Autonomous Sales Performance Coach"
An AI agent continuously monitors sales rep interactions, sentiment, and performance. 
It autonomously triggers coaching actions, schedules follow-ups, alerts managers, and improves rep behavior‚Äîwithout being asked.


üîç Value	AI is faster at spotting patterns (e.g., low sentiment + stalled deals) than a manager; improves productivity and consistency.
üõ†Ô∏è Work	The agent listens to calls, evaluates sentiment, checks pipeline health, and takes actions like sending coaching Slack messages, scheduling training, or flagging issues to managers.
üìä Decision-Making	Uses logic trees: e.g., "If call sentiment < 0.4 and opportunity stage = Proposal, then trigger 'Pricing Objection' coaching tip and Slack to rep + manager."
‚öñÔ∏è Risk	Works within Salesforce‚Äôs ecosystem. Does not override user permissions. All actions logged and traceable.
üì° Data	Leverages Conversation Insights, Opportunity history, sentiment analysis, and Data Cloud for unified profiles.


What the Autonomous Agent Does:
üß≠ Monitors sales rep calls & pipeline in real time
üß† Applies LLM + rules to decide coaching actions
üí¨ Sends actionable Slack messages to reps with coaching tips
üìÜ Schedules coaching sessions or micro-trainings via Flow
üìà Tracks response impact (conversion rate, win rate, sentiment improvement)
